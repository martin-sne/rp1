# possible check AD, RD RA flag set by a auth server

get SOA record for a domain from a resolver to get authoritative NS servers back
test this NS servers if they behave like auth server should do, not responsde to recursive DNS queries


# possible check --> collect data (see below) for each NS in master/slave and register it to our MIB
--> Monitoring scripts could use this data to retrieve terrible diffs (e.g. KSK different, or different DS records)
get KSK and ZSK, DS and RRSIG from Master/slave --> register to variable


# Pre test Mib scenario (fake file dynamically changing)
Imitate our mib and feed it with VITAL data to the python class (using generic datastructures (1000 zones or so) )
Run queries against HUGE SNMP table and gather data (RRD)


# In real world (if doable)
-	requires to configure 500 delegations (per script) to each bind instances
-	requires requires to collect data properly (validns or own scripts)
