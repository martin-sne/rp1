\section{Proof of Concept}
\label{chap:proof_of_concept}
The research team will create an SNMP MIB module that will cover DNSSEC critical parameters. Hence, we will collect data from different sources (DNSSEC signer instance, authoritative DNS data). To make the defined SNMP variables and tables accessible to monitoring tools, our MIB module needs to be registered to an SNMP master agent through an AgentX \cite{agentx} sub agent.
