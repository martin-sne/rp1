As pointed out earlier, there are plenty of monitoring system already existing\cite{list}, but we are a looking for an integrated SNMP-compliant tool. We would like to write our SNMP sub-agent in Python, and some work has already been done towards that direction. Indeed, \textit{python-netsnmpagent}\cite{pythonnetsnmpagent} is a Python module that allows to easily write Net-SNMP subagents in Python. In addition, \textit{snmp-passpersist}\cite{passpersist} facilitates the creation of a MIB subtree. However, MIBs for DNSSEC monitoring do not seem to have ever been created.
