\section{Scope}
\label{chap:Scope}
The scope of our research project is to develop an SNMP-compliant monitoring prototype solution which spots relevant DNSSEC data of DNSSEC-enabled zones.
That implies the construction of a DNSSEC-SNMP MIB module. The research team  will define a generic structure for the MIB and the data that should go into it.

Moreover, the MIB module needs to be implemented in an SNMP sub agent. The SNMP variables inside that SNMP MIB module need to get updated frequently in order to provide fresh and valuable data to SNMP-based monitoring probes.

Finally, if time permits, the research team will try to implement the MIB module in such a way that new zone data will be appended automatically to the SNMP MIB module tree structure as soon as a new DNS domain is detected.
