\section{Requirements}
\label{chap:Requirements}
To conduct our research we need two physical servers. On both servers an authoritative DNS server instance will be active, serving at least one DNSSEC enabled zone. Furthermore we will setup an OPENDNSSEC signing instance. We will run our SNMP AgentX subagent on top of the NET-SNMP application \cite{net-snmp}. NET-SNMP will run on one server instance. To show our solution and its use in practice, we will implement a simple monitoring check and implement it in the well known monitoring system Nagios \cite{nagios}.
