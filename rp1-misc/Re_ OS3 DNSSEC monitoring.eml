Hi guys,

I had expected this to arrive at 23:59:59 after your question if it =
could be submitted until midnight :)  Below, I=92m trying to cover as =
much as possible, to help you achieve the best possible report.  So what =
follows is very detailed; please don=92t be discouraged by that, it is a =
sign of interest in your work rather than seeing a lot wrong with it.

After changing the document, could you send me a unified diff of your =
pdfLaTeX source please?  It=92s easier to process your changes that way. =
 I=92m fluent in LaTeX anyway=85 you don=92t get a PhD degree without =
[1] ;-)

	[1] although many have tried, but Word keeps crashing on them =
when they get halfway their book :-D

The English is pretty good, and probably the best I=92ve seen from OS3 =
students.  My compliments on that.

Scientific style: The path from vital life signs in 3.2 to their =
implementation in 4.2 is not clear.  It=92s almost as if they are =
diffierent stories, with no connecting thoughts.  This is not true of =
course, but your report isn=92t clear on the connection.  Naturally, 4.2 =
is based on what is done in the field; it would add to the =
=93scientificness=94 of the report if you could evaluate what you found =
against what you state as vital signs in 3.2.

Completeness: I am not always sure about design considerations.  Does a =
monitoring solution need to run over very large tables, or is the amount =
of work in fact restricted because not all =93OK=94 RRDATA is mentioned =
and just the things that are out-of-the-ordinary?  Is the work expected =
of the monitoring solution in the line of what tools like Nagios et al =
do, notably does it not require complex computations and/or comparisons =
between otherwise unrelated objects e.g. SOA counters?

The abstract needs work, it should give an idea in general terms of what =
work you=92ve done.  It abstracts from concrete details such as the =
approach, but may contain a bit on the motivations and aspirations.

Introduction, the =93common format=94 for SNMP is even a =93standard =
format=94.  =93custom made solutions=94 =97> =93custom-made solutions=94 =
 (because custom applies to made, not to solutions).

Ref [4] to RFC 1611 isn=92t a very strong one, its status is HISTORIC, =
see https://www.ietf.org/download/rfc-index.txt and the explaination in =
RFC 3197.  Or, as stated in RFC 6168: "Previous standardization work =
within the IETF resulted in the creation of two SNMP MIB modules =
[RFC1611] [RFC1612], but they failed to achieve significant =
implementation and deployment.  The perceived reasons behind the failure =
for the two MIB modules are documented in [RFC3197].=94  =97 but I do =
agree it is helpful to look at in line with this work, of course.

2.1 SNMP is not a =93de facto standard=94 but a full-blown IETF =
standard, so it=92s closer to the opposite, =93a de jure standard=94 :) =
but nobody would say it like that.  It=92s plain and simply an Internet =
Standard.
You might want to add a remark that the =93set=94 facilities in SNMP =
never made it to real-life use because of its limited security; nowadays =
we have new options (one could use IPsec, or one might send SNMP over =
SCTP with a protection layer) but other protocols seem to be leading the =
=93set=94 aspect, so SNMP is only used in =93get=94 mode.

2.2 =93rolled-over=94 -> =93roll over=94 (the dash is used to form a =
combined adjective)
=93It is not hard to notice=94 is subjective information.

3 =93DNSSEC related data=94 -> =93DNSSEC-related data=94 (combined =
adjective) =97 will stop quoting that form from here on :)
=93those component=94 -> =93those components=94
=93independent=94 prototype -> perhaps you meant to say =
=93self-contained=94?

3.2, 2nd (KSK): =93In doing so, the monitoring solution assumes that the =
advised setting of the SEP bit on the KSK and only the KSK is followed =
by the DNSSEC implementation, which is commonly the case.=94  (it is not =
formally required by the RFCs on DNSSEC, but it is habitually followed.)
* 3rd, what is the different between #DS and #delegations?  Do you mean =
#DS =3D=3D #DNSKEY-with-SEP?  BTW, what you are saying is not true.  For =
every signature algorithm (RSA-SHA1, RSA-SHA256, DSA-SHA1, and so on) =
there must be at least one match between a DS and a DSKEY; addition DS =
and/or DNSKEY RR are not harmful.  I do agree however, that it hints at =
something that might be either undergoing change or, if it persists, =
something that is not being managed properly.  The distinction is =
between =93formally wrong=94 and =93sign of trouble=94.
* 4th, (TTL), I don=92t really understand what you are saying here.  =
Please spell =93re-signing=94 instead of =93resigning=94 =97 the latter =
means to remove oneself from a job or assignment.
* 6th, inception/expiration.  Are you not proposing to monitor bad =
inception times?  Explain why.
* 7th, =93incremented=94 -> =93increased=94 (I=92m not entirely sure; =
maybe this is my mind, but I feel =93increment=94 to mean +1, perhaps =
due to having seen most assembly level =93inc=94 instructions implement =
a +=3D1 operation).

3.3.1, "indexes for SNMP tables can be assigned to several basic =
datatypes=94 =97 not factually true, it is not restricted to =93basic=94 =
datatypes AFAIK, but might even have combinations of basic datatypes as =
keys.  Not a big issue, mainly a matter of wording.  It is nice to see =
how you picked up on this advise by the way, I really think it improved =
the outcome.
=93handle with strings=94 -> =93handle strings=94
* You are mentioning the ASCII character set, but during your =
presentation you spoke of UTF-8 encoded strings; that would only be of =
interest when going beyond the ASCII set by using the Unicode character =
set (which includes ASCII as a subset, and UTF-8 encoding would lead to =
the normal ASCII representation in bytes with a zero MSB).  Had you used =
Punycode to represent int=92l characters then the OCTET-STRING would =
indeed have contained ASCII.

3.4 =93Chapter 1=94, isn=92t it =93Section 1=94?

4.1.1, XML was a surprise to me, as it introduces risk of race =
conditions (one process writes while the other wants to read) and slows =
down processing (at least, I=92ve seen process slow down due to XML =
parsing, much to my surprise).  These concerns of consistency and =
scalability are aggrevated by your choice to make one large XML file =
with all the data.  This choice is suitable for a 4-week prototype but =
some form of database (perhaps a blazing-fast key-value store) would =
have been my choice.  Not a vital problem though, you=92ve made a choice =
which is certainly common and defensible.  Still, I thought the =
reflection might be useful for you to learn from.

Ref 22, and maximum 255 in an OCTET-STRING: does the limit apply to =
Punycode or UTF-8 representations?  That might make a difference=85 but =
I=92ll grant you that this is me nitpicking.  Maybe something to =
mention?

Fig 3, can you show the link with the symbolic OID names?  That was my =
reason for enthousiasm about the slides, the fact that you made this =
link so clear, and thus showed brightly how your MIB is structured.

Table 2, 1st column: perhaps \sf or \tt for the API calls to show that =
it is code.  Are you sure there isn=92t a dot missing in the 3rd row?

4.3 holds a =93TODO=94

4.3, I very much believe that you=92ve made an architecturally sane =
choice by decoupling the XML procssing from the SNMP responsiveness.  =
Also see the XML remarks above =97 you are taking most of that away from =
my feedback; scalability issues are now reduced to processing changes =
fast enough.

Conclusion.  You might want to add a bit.  What are the pros and cons of =
your approach, have you stumbled on new findings.  Do you believe that =
the structure of what you=92ve done is the =93right fit=94 for the task =
it addresses, or are other approaches better?  For instance, did you =
manage to get something that is =93more general=94 than the local =
monitoring solutions, and did you nonetheless manage to keep it as =
informative?  Any insights about the automatic pickup of newly added =
zones?

The images look like vector graphics that were exported and then =
inserted as pixel-format pictures, such as PNG or JPG.  Your tool can =
probably export PDF, which is easily included into pdfLaTeX as well =97 =
and it=92ll look much better.  The current ones are barely readable.  =
(This is generally useful to learn, because if you ever supply such =
results to a book-printer in the future, you=92ll drive them mad.  I =
remember how tense they were when I asked them to print my PhD thesis =97 =
what format did I use?  So I replied a completely vectorial PDF starting =
at page 1 and ending on page 182 and I could hear them loosening up over =
the phone line.  Grinn.  Indeed, later I caught them explaining to a =
Windows-no-no that spiffy 72 dpi on-screen images look very poor in =
600dpi print resolution!)  As an alternative, you could output with more =
pixels and scale down in pdfLaTeX =97 the file gets larger but at least =
the pictures are more easily readable.

Drop the \appendix statement if you don=92t add appendices please ;-) =
and you also shouldn=92t have an empty =93Acknowledgements=94 section.

Will you remember to checkin slides and final report in a doc/ directory =
at GitHUB?

Thanks for all your good work, and who knows=85 maybe we=92ll cross =
swords again during your RP2 :-)

-Rick=
